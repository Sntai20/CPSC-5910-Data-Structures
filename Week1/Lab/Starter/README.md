# Lab 1

1. Download the code from Starter.
1. Open it in CLion.
1. Add a "Date" class that satisfies the requirements so that the testdriver.cpp code runs with no errors.

Specifically:
* Date has a ```GetDisplayFormat()``` method that prints a string like:

  ```"January 5 is the 5 day of 2020"```

* Date throws some exceptions in invalid input.
    * These can be inferred from the driver code.

* There is a Solution directory available but try not to look at it unless you get really stuck.
