 * Problem 3: Write a program that: Prompts the user to enter an integer n, Creates an array of
 * random integers of size n where all values are between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Sort this array
 * in O(n) time. Hint: Research "sort in linear time" or "sort in O(n) time" on the Internet.
 * Print the sorted array to the console. Your program should be fully contained in a file
 * called HW7-3.cpp and compile with the standard command-line flags.
